* The Motivation
.link https://anilist.co/forum/thread/1536/1 Anime Guessing Game
.link http://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=1404673 Help Identifying The Anime
.link https://yuki.la/wsr/111302 Know the anime but can't find the scene

Image reverse search engines

- [[https://images.google.com/][Google Image]] - Results are limited
- [[https://www.tineye.com/][TinEye]] - never works on anime
- [[https://iqdb.org][iqdb]] - tailored for doujin artwork, not anime
- [[https://saucenao.com/][SauceNAO]] - covers iqdb plus game CG
.caption tried to include anime many years ago but never works, see [[https://saucenao.com/status.html][database status]]
- [[https://whatanime.ga][whatanime.ga]] - tailored for anime

* Demo

* How does it work?

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-based_image_retrieval][Content-based image retrieval (CBIR)]]

There is a long list of CBIR engine/libraries/projects on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_CBIR_engines][wikipedia]]

whatanime.ga uses [[http://www.lire-project.net/][Lire]] which has a [[https://bitbucket.org/dermotte/liresolr][solr plugin]]

Common image descriptors:
- Color Layout
- Edge Histogram
- Opponent Histogram
- ScalableColor
- etc.

whatanime.ga only uses Color Layout due to Hardware limitations

* Brief idea of Color Layout 
- one of the [[http://mpeg.chiariglione.org/standards/mpeg-7/visual][MPEG-7 standard]]
- Raw Image -> Partition to 8x8 blocks -> take average color of each block -> convert color space to YCbCr -> DCT transform (quantize) -> Zigzag scanning
.image whatanime.ga/inko.jpg _ 240
.caption Raw image
.image whatanime.ga/inko64.png _ 240
.caption extracted image feature: FQYLBAQRFgoYFBANEBIQDw0QCw0PDxAeEhEQDhAfDQ8PEA8=

* Use CBIR for analyzing video
Raw Video -> FFmpeg extract all frames -> Lire extract image features -> deduplicate images with same image features with a running window of 12 frames -> append timestamp -> load into solr
.image whatanime.ga/extracted.png _ 680
.caption extracted image features after deduplication and appending timestamp

* Hash distribution of Color Layout on 15000 hours of Anime
.image whatanime.ga/histogram.jpg _ 800
.caption 14 Dec 2015 (blue) compared to 18 Apr 2016 (red). Graph shifted upwards evenly

* Hash distribution of Color Layout on 15000 hours of Anime
.image whatanime.ga/histogram.png _ 800
.caption hash sorted by popularity
.caption search is almost instant if it found a match under the 10000 line

* Some optimization on searching
whatanime.ga is targeted for almost exact match, not visually similar images
- Assumption: consider similarity < 90% as no match
- Stop searching once a good result (Similarity > 90%) is found
- No need to continue searching after 10% of extracted image feature is searched
- warmup data with [[https://github.com/hoytech/vmtouch][vmtouch]]
- cache high confidence search results in redis
- cache less confidence search results in redis too, but expire sooner

* Statistics
- 15600 hours video from 2395 anime series analyzed (~8.4TB)
.caption it took 2 quad core-i7 machines 2 months to complete
- 414 Million analyzed frames after deduplication, 76GB in solr
- Automatically analyze new animes
- indexing speed: ~65 seconds for an 24-minute 720p anime (~35s extract, ~25s hashing, ~5s dedup and transform)
- runs on an i7-4770 with 32GB RAM
- search time: varies between 0-40 seconds );
- 500+ users of its Chrome Extension ;)
- Referrals from partner website SauceNao (thanks [[https://twitter.com/SauceNAO][Xamayon]])
- Hundreds of fans sharing it on [[https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=whatanime.ga&src=savs][Twitter]], [[http://www.plurk.com/w/#whatanime.ga?time=365][plurk]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/newsokur/comments/4932zx/][reddit]], [[https://www.google.com/webhp?#q=site:vk.com+%22whatanime.ga%22][VK]]

* What's Next?
Kind of experiment right now
- badly written sourcecode
- misplaced anime not cleaned up yet

Keep a close eye on [[https://github.com/joshstar/AniList-API-Docs][AniList API]], it may launch APIv2 later this year
Develop a Firefox Add-on
Wait for facebook to approve the [[https://twitter.com/soruly/status/720633945189015553][Messenger Bot]]
Develop more IM bots, any ideas?

Other Potential usage:
- something like youtube contentID
- auto tagger
- advertise for commercial online anime websites / anime producers

What about search by audio?
- possible, [[https://github.com/worldveil/dejavu][library]] exists for this purpose
