2018: slope of enlightenment

* What is WAIT?
- [[https://whatanime.ga]] is an Anime Scene Search Engine
- Given an anime screenshot, it tells you which episode and timecode it appears

.caption What anime? Which episode? Time code?

* How does it work?

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-based_image_retrieval][Content-based image retrieval (CBIR)]]

There is a long list of CBIR engine/libraries/projects on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_CBIR_engines][wikipedia]]

whatanime.ga uses [[http://www.lire-project.net/][Lire]] which has a [[https://bitbucket.org/dermotte/liresolr][solr plugin]]

Common image descriptors:
- Color Layout
- Edge Histogram
- Opponent Histogram
- ScalableColor
- etc.

whatanime.ga only uses Color Layout due to Hardware limitations

* How does it work? - Color Layout
- one of the [[http://mpeg.chiariglione.org/standards/mpeg-7/visual][MPEG-7 standard]]
- Raw Image -> Partition to 8x8 blocks -> take average color of each block -> convert color space to YCbCr -> DCT transform (quantize) -> Zigzag scanning
.caption [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_layout_descriptor]]

.caption extracted image feature: FQYLBAQRFgoYFBANEBIQDw0QCw0PDxAeEhEQDhAfDQ8PEA8=

* How does it work? - Color Layout for each frame
raw video -> extract all frames by ffmpeg -> extract image features by LIRE -> deduplicate duplicated hashes -> append timestamp -> load into solr
.image 2018-06-whatanime.ga/extracted.png _ 780
.caption extracted image features after deduplication and appending timestamp

* How does it work? - Comparing hashes, at scale
image similarity = similarity of two strings = 1 - edit distance of two strings (cl_hi)
Reduce search area by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality-sensitive_hashing][Locality Sensitive Hashing]]
Comparing 700 million strings -> compare 1 million strings
.image 2018-06-whatanime.ga/extracted.png _ 680
.caption cl_ha is for speeding up search for cl_hi

* How does it work? - Comparing hashes, at scale
Choose 1 out of 100 hash terms for search, starting from the least populated one.
dermotte accepted this idea and [[https://github.com/dermotte/liresolr/commit/4d500548c8e34f245de440e810bf0893e87ddbe9][implemented this as IDF into liresolr]]

* Updates since 2017

* New features / changes
- New server!

- Moved from CentOS to Fedora
- Improved performance by multi-core search
- Improved accuracy by adding auto black border crop
- Added groups support for [[https://github.com/soruly/whatanime.ga-telegram-bot][Telegram Bot]]
- Created [[https://discord.gg/K9jn6Kj][Discord Channel]] and [[https://telegram.me/whatanimeupdates][Telegram Channel]]

* New server :D
.image 2018-06-whatanime.ga/server.jpg _ 900
.caption 2 x E5-2696v4 (44 Core 88 Threads), 128GB RAM

* multi-core (database) search
- liresolr is single thread... and solrcloud does not work well with plugin schemas
- split index into 32 databases (solr cores), [[https://twitter.com/soruly/status/982954746016223232][each having 23 million hashes, ~4.4GB]]
- balance cores by loading hashes into least populated cores
- curl parallel search on all databases, and combine results with php
- all database (solr cores) are hosted in one server

.caption [[https://twitter.com/soruly/status/982953644562595840]]

* black border detection and auto crop
Using [[https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/imgproc/shapedescriptors/find_contours/find_contours.html][findContours]] from OpenCV to crop black borders
.image 2018-06-whatanime.ga/crop.jpg _ 600
.caption similarity: with black border 89.4%, without border 96.3%
.caption [[https://twitter.com/soruly/status/930080021502291968]]

* Statistics

* Where are we now?
2016: "It's magic!", "It's super awesome!!"
2017: "It's not accurate!", "It doesn't work as expected"
2018: Most users understand the design and limitations of whatanime.ga

* What is WAIT? Actually
whatanime.ga has nothing to do with:
- AI
- Machine Learning
- blockchain

whatanime.ga is kind of:
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-based_image_retrieval][Content-based image retrieval (CBIR)]] search engine
- computer graphics program
- big data (depends on how you define big)

whatanime.ga index includes:
- anime from TV, OVA, ONA, Movie

whatanime.ga index does not include:
- comics, doujin artwork, anime posters or covers

* Slope of enlightenment
whatanime.ga will not:
- cover comics / artworks
- allow search by timecode
- increase duration of preview
- add ads to websites

whatanime.ga will:
- Increase database coverage (fill in missing anime and maybe crawling from youtube)
- Reduce duplicates in database
- Support multiple image descriptors like FCTH (Fuzzy Color and Texture Histogram)
- Rebuild web front-end for language and mobile support (contributors welcome)
- move to a new domain (considering [[trace.moe]])

* One more thing...

* sola
.caption Those weird shell scripts and python scripts are now organized into a new project
[[https://github.com/soruly/sola]]

- Helper command to setup liresolr and multiple solr cores
- Distributed workers for indexing video
- Load pre-hashed files into multiple cores (balanced)
- Frame deduplication
- Watch folder and index new videos automatically
- Post updates to telegram channel
- Search multiple cores at once
- Scalable to search 700 million frames in <3 seconds

.caption It's time to build your own Anime/Video Scene Search Engine!

* New Overview
.image 2018-06-whatanime.ga/diagram.svg _ 750

* All parts of whatanime.ga are open source!
